D3 Engineering DesignCore™ Camera Mezzanine Board OV5640 enables direct connection of up to two MIPI CSI-2 cameras to the DragonBoard™ 410c. Direct MIPI CSI-2 access to camera data allows more realistic evaluation of embedded vision designs. Eliminating the need to decode USB or Ethernet protocols results in lower power and higher performance.
