#Ground

The Ground pins on 96Boards are all electrically connected, so it doesn't matter
which one you use if you're wiring up a voltage supply.

Generally the one that's most convenient or closest to the rest of your connections is tidier
and easier, or alternatively the one closest to the supply pin that you use.
